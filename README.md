# Slisic

A compact music player built around smart shuffle and consistent listening experience.

## Features

- Download and manage media from most major streaming platforms (powered by yt-dlp) or import from local folders.
- Shuffle playback driven by user-guided probability distributions â€” randomness tuned to feel natural.
- Loudness normalization (based on LUFS) for a consistent listening volume across different tracks.
- Automatically split and name media with embedded chapter information (powered by FFmpeg).
